The Architect's Mandate License (AML) v1.0
PREAMBLE

This document is not merely a license; it is a blueprint for engagement. It governs the use of the software and intellectual property ("The Work") created by Josephis K. Wade ("The Architect"). The Work is a component of a larger, interconnected digital ecosystem designed with specific principles of integrity, security, and performance. This Mandate ensures that any use of The Work upholds and respects the architectural integrity of that ecosystem. Use of The Work in any capacity constitutes a binding agreement to the terms laid forth in this Mandate.

Article 1: Definitions
1.1. "The Architect" refers to Josephis K. Wade, the sole creator and rights holder of The Work.

1.2. "The Work" refers to the software, source code, object code, documentation, and all associated intellectual property to which this license is applied.

1.3. "The Ecosystem" refers to the collection of interconnected projects developed by The Architect, including but not limited to EmPower1, CritterCraftUniverse, Prometheus Protocol (QRASL), V-Architect, EchoSphere, and DashAIBrowser.

1.4. "Permitted Use" refers to the specific, limited rights granted to a user of The Work under this Mandate.

1.5. "Prohibited Use" refers to any action or application of The Work that is not explicitly granted under Permitted Use.

Article 2: Grant of Limited License
The Architect hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use The Work strictly for the following purposes:

2.1. Personal, Non-Commercial Use: You may use The Work for personal projects, research, and evaluation that do not generate revenue and are not conducted on behalf of a commercial entity.

2.2. Educational Use: You may use The Work in the context of learning, teaching, and academic research within a recognized educational institution.

Article 3: Restrictions and Prohibitions
All rights not explicitly granted in Article 2 are reserved by The Architect. The following actions constitute Prohibited Use and are a direct violation of this Mandate:

3.1. Commercial Use: You may not use, integrate, or deploy The Work in any product, service, or environment that is intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation, without a separate, explicit commercial license granted in writing by The Architect.

3.2. Modification and Derivative Works: You may not modify, decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works based on The Work. The architectural integrity of The Work must be preserved.

3.3. Redistribution: You may not distribute, sublicense, rent, lease, or lend The Work or any copies thereof to any third party.

3.4. Ecosystem Undermining: You may not use The Work in any manner that compromises the security, privacy, or data integrity of its users, or that acts in opposition to the core principles of user sovereignty embedded within The Ecosystem.

3.5. Unlawful Use: You may not use The Work for any purpose that is unlawful, unethical, malicious, or in violation of any applicable international, federal, state, or local laws.

Article 4: Intellectual Property
The Architect retains all right, title, and interest in and to The Work, including all copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights. This Mandate does not grant you any ownership rights to The Work.

Article 5: Termination
This license is effective until terminated. Your rights under this Mandate will terminate automatically and without notice from The Architect if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this license. Upon termination, you shall cease all use of The Work and destroy all copies, full or partial, of The Work.

Article 6: Disclaimer of Warranty & Limitation of Liability
THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ARCHITECT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE WORK.

Article 7: Severability and Reformation
This clause ensures the resilience and adaptability of the Mandate, reflecting a core architectural principle.

7.1. If any provision, article, or term of this Mandate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed severed from this Mandate.

7.2. In the event of such a severance, the remainder of this Mandate shall continue in full force and effect, as if the unenforceable provision had never been a part hereof.

7.3. Furthermore, if a provision is deemed unenforceable, the court is hereby requested and authorized to reform or modify the provision. The reformed provision should achieve the closest possible legal and economic effect to the original provision's intent, as agreed upon by the presiding judicial authority, while rendering it enforceable. This reformation is preferred over simple severance to maintain the strategic integrity of the Mandate.

Article 8: Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This Mandate shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of South Dakota, United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any legal action or proceeding arising under this Mandate will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Rapid City, South Dakota, and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.

By installing, copying, or otherwise using The Work, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Architect's Mandate License.
